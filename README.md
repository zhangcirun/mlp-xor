Introduction
--------------
In this project, a simple backprpagation neural network (BP network) is developed for solving the XOR problem. The XOR problem is a typical inseparable problem in the field of artificial neural network (ANN). It is the problem of implementing a neural network to predict the outputs of two binary inputs through an exclusive-or logic gates.
